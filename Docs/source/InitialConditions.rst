Initial Conditions
==================

The initial conditions are generated by a set of scripts that describe the angular distribution of particles and the number density associated with each particle. Note that there is a mismatch between the units of initial condition quantities (number density) and code quantities (number) to allow for different grid cell sizes to use the same initial condition script.
